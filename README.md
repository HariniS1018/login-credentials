# login-credentials 

### Description:
'Login credentials' is my personal mini project using Java language only. This personal project is a team project of two members and one among is me. I have developed model, controller and view of login and registration of user.

### Project description:
'Login credentials' needs each user to register themselves with valid user id and password. After successful registeration, they can login using the authorized user id and password. If the user give authorised input, then there displays a successful login message.

### Project status:
This project needs Email verification so that only the authorised user can access his details. This is planned to develop soon.

### Development Environment:
This project needs just a java compiler to run and we can use any text editor to write the program and run it on ur command line prompt.

To compile the program written in the text editor, type the following in cmd:
javac file_name.java

To execute the same, Execute the following in cmd:
java file_name
Here, view_page file alone is enough to execute since that file will invoke others explicitly

### Testing:
For registration, the user_id can be 1001 and the password can be 'Login@01'
